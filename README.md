# Advection Solver

This project solves 9-point stencil on a torus plane with 3 approaches

1. [MPI](https://github.com/abhaasgoyal/Advection-Solver/tree/master/MPI) - Fastest for smaller matrices, second in larger matrices
2. [OpenMP](https://github.com/abhaasgoyal/Advection-Solver/tree/master/openmp) - Slowest performance out of all three
3. [CUDA](https://github.com/abhaasgoyal/Advection-Solver/tree/master/cuda) - Second in slower matrices, fastest in larger matrices
